						<div class="recoitem">"Kartik's first project at Suddenlink was to advise and lead the development of the company's public website. This entailed quite a bit of research as well as hands on coding 							and team management. Kartik performed so well that upon completion, he was quickly assigned to develop/lead/manage several additional projects. His technical and organization skills so impressed 								management that eventually, Kartik was named to design, develop and be personally accountable for one of the largest, most mission critical integrations Suddenlink had seen to date. The project 							finished and was a huge success do to the foresight, diligence and long hours that Kartik contributed to the project. Kartik has since taken a very active role designing and building out both the 							physical and logical infrastructure - recently leading migrations to both a new physical server platform as well as a company-wide SOA solution. Kartik has a great balance of systems 							experience, technical skill, professionalism (and curiosity) such that I think he would complement any team he might work on."

						"Kartik and I worked together on a challenging project to integrate a cable telephony billing system (acting as an order management system) with a provisioning system. While most of telephony was new to Kartik when the project began, he picked up on the idiosyncrasies with amazing speed - primarily due to his thirst for knowledge and desire to understand the industry. He also stays on top of all that is new and progressive in the development world, which resulted in a better finished product and also made his interaction with software vendors more productive. Kartik's intelligence, adaptability and genuine interest in the products he designs make working with him a truly refreshing experience."<br>

						"Kartik worked as the design/developer of a critical integration application between two enterprise systems. He worked with a small core team to define, design, develope, test and implement this solution. Kartik was key to the success of this application and I would recommend him for any complex solution development initiative within any organization."<br>

						"If a detail-oriented nature, out of the box thinking, foresight and a thirst for excellence be necessary for a post, Kartik would be a perfect candidate for it. On the occasions that our professional paths crossed, I have observed a refreshingly frank nature coupled with technical genius in him, which is a rare - and welcome - combination. There have also been quite a few instances when his insight provided us with alternatives which were of substantial economic value. For all these points, I have no reservations recommending him as a valuable leader in any organization."<br>

During his tenure with us, he played an instrumental role in the design and development of several major platform introductions. Kartik always had a keen eye for ensuring all technical designs exceeded the expectations of our business units. His energy for identifying cutting edge, yet practical solutions ensured the solutions, once implemented will continue to support the business operations with high quality/minimal support. I strongly endorse Kartik."<br>

						"Kartik was the Technical Architect of one of the project in GE IRI and was highly respected by his colleagues and the customers for his enormous technical and management skills. The web based applications designed by Kartik around 7-8 years back still runs bereft of any problem. Apart from his technical &amp; managerial skills, Kartik is a motivator, team worker, and a go getter. Each of us working under him were really proud of him. If I ever start a software firm, I would be glad to offer a Project Manager role and I am very confident that he will exceed my expectations."<br>
